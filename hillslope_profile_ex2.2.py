"""Calculates a steady-state profile of a diffusive hillslope.

Description:
    This script calculates a steady-state profile of a diffusive hillslope
    with rivers incising at the lateral margins of the hillslope. It also
    loads a topographic profile for comparison with the model predictions.
    
    User-defined variables are listed at the top of the script
    
Usage:
    ./hillslope_profile_ex2.2.py
